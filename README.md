# WIFI-JTAG

ESP8266 (ESP-12) for $4 as WIFI JTAG adapter.
This could be the simplest, the cheapest and the slowest JTAG adapter.

Here's arduino code for ESP8266 which listens to TCP port 3335 
and talks remote_bitbang protocol with OpenOCD over WiFi and a serial port
version of the same, for use with any arduino (without WIFI).

It can upload SVF bistream over WIFI network to the FPGA.

Works for FPGA boards TB276 (Altera Cyclone-4) and TB299 (Xilinx Spartan-6)

What works for one FPGA, doesn't neccessary work for the other.

# TCP-Serial

Wifi-jtag can enter tcp-serial bridge mode, thus allowing remote
serial communication to FPGA over WiFi.
Serial break may be issued with K or ctrl-@ at start of telnet session.
Serial break resets FPGArduino F32C CPU and enters bootloader,
which can accept a hex or binary executable file.

    telnet jtag.lan 3335
    K
    mi32l>
    ctrl-]
    telnet> mode char
    mi32l>
    mi32l>
  
virtual serial port:

    socat -d -d pty,link=/dev/ttyS5,raw,echo=0  tcp:xilinx.lan:3335
  
sending ascii file over tcp. (executable compiled hex file).

    socat -u FILE:blink.cpp.hex TCP:jtag.lan:3335

*Warning: at power up, GPIO15 should not be connected to FPGA 
(let it have only pull down resistor), 
If left connected, FPGA may pull it up during power on and 
ESP8266 will not boot.

Avoid using GPIO 0, 2, 15, 16 for JTAG signals, as those
pins need to be at some default state at power on for ESP8266
to boot firmware. Use ESP-12 as it has has plenty of GPIO.
There's complete development board with micro usb:
https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit

TRST and SRST are reset signals usually used for ARM debugging.
Most FPGA don't need them. LED may be left unconnected too.
WIFI-JTAG board can be directly powered from JTAG connector.

# Compiling

Precompiled binary is available in bin/

Default SSID=ssid PASSWORD=password

It has to be compiled to change SSID and PASSWORD.

To compile from source you need ESP8266 Arduino.
Download from http://arduino.cc and unpack arduino-1.6.4 or higher.
Then add support for ESP8266

This is the main project that started it all
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
Automatic installation using JSON is now avaialble
in File->Default Settings->Additional Boards Manager URLs enter:

    http://arduino.esp8266.com/package_esp8266com_index.json

Select pull down menu Tools->Board->Board Manager
and instal ESP8266 (cca 30MB).

https://github.com/sandeepmistry/esp8266-Arduino
version 0.0.5 is simple to manually install 
(just copy to ~/Arduino/hardware) 
and has pretty stable and fast TCP stack.

Adafruit has some ESP8266 has JSON install but 
speed and stability of TCP is not the best (old library?).
in File->Default Settings->Additional Boards Manager URLs enter:

    https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json

Select pull down menu Tools->Board->Board Manager and instal ESP8266 (cca 30MB). 


# Speed

JTAG upload is slow because OpenOCD creates network 
traffic with short packets of 1-3 bytes sending to and 
from WIFI-JTAG. Watch the traffic:

    tcpdump -A port 3335

Switching direction from receive to transmit takes time
1-300 ms.

Time uploading FPGArduino https://github.com/f32c 

    750KB SVF file to TB276 (Altera Cyclone-4)
    WiFi sandeepmistry 0.0.5 : 1:45 minutes
    Serial 230400 baud       : 4:20 minutes

    1.4MB SVF file to TB299 (Xilinx Spartan-6)
    WiFi sandeepmistry 0.0.5 : 1:30 minutes

# Reliability

Firmware is useable but not completely stable.
It may sometimes stop working when just connected 
to WIFI access point even if JTAG is not used.
We recommend to power it on just before use.

# Improvement

There is much room for improvement of course: network protocol
from OpenOCD could be optimized to allow longer packets, buffering,
compression (instead of sending same sequence many times), use some
hardware optimization in the ESP8266 like SPI as JTAG accelerator, 
or SVF player approach from JTAGWhisperer.

# LUA (not useable)

LUA version of the above does the same protocol but in 
practice it will not work for longer transfers, only
boundary scan. Works unstable and often reboots. 
It is here just as a proof-of-concept.
